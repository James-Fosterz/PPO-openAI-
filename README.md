# PPO-openAI

This was Unviersity Coursework that has been preovously submitted and shows my learning as obviously much of this can be improved. All worked was udnertaken with a partner and the coursework was submitted together.

This task was very enjoyable as workign with the algorithsm provide by OpenAI are very interesting. They are also incredilbly clever as to how they go about approcahing the task.

The agolrithm implemented is PPO (Proximal Policy Optimisation) and information on it can be found at:
